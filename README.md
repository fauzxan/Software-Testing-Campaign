# Software-Testing-Campaign

### Steps to view functionality:
<br />
1. Make a copy of the file on your local device: <br />
<t /><t /> a. Clone the repository using github Desktop or command line, or<br />
<t /><t /> b. Download the zip file and extract the folder into a folder of your choice<br />
<br />
2. Open the code in your IDE. The code consists of a single class-  ./src/main.java<br /><br />
3. In order to test the code you need to input the correct file path into the file1 and file2 variables in public static void main(String args[])<br />

##### You only need to modify these two lines in ./src/main.java

```
File file1 = new File("__enter filepath for the first CSV file you want to test__");
File file2 = new File("__enter filepath for the second CSV file you want to test__");
```

<br />
<br />
4. Run the code and see the output terminal to see how many lines are mismatched<br /><br />
5. Open the folder where you extracted the files to see the output stored in output.csv<br /><br />
<br />
<br />
